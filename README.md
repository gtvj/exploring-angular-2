## Notes

### Week 1

#### TypeScript

Angular 2 source code is written in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). By using Typescript to write our Angular 2 code we are able to use ES2015 now, including: 

* Classes
* Modules
* Strong typing
* Decorators

#### Angular overview

* Components
    * The 'bootstrap' component
    * Each component can have an HTML template to which you can wire up:
        * Events
        * Data
    * Nesting components
    * Created using the Component class
    
#### Task - Angular 2 Quick Start
